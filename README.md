# day-piece-webview

Embed a real browser view in a Day app.

`WKWebView` on macOS and iOS, WebKitGTK on Linux, `QWebEngineView` on Qt, and Android's
`WebView` — one Rust API for loading URLs and hearing about navigation. Where a platform
combination has no workable engine, the piece reports that plainly instead of bundling a
browser of its own.

Pieces are Day's reusable UI components, shipped as ordinary crates: one Rust API in
front, a real native control per platform behind it. Enable the backends you build for
with cargo features, and `day build` wires up the native side automatically.

## Part of Day

This crate is one piece of [Day](https://daybrite.dev), a Rust framework for building apps
out of each platform's real native widgets — AppKit, UIKit, Android's Material widgets,
GTK 4, Qt 6, WinUI, and ArkUI — from one codebase. There is no web view and no bundled
rendering engine: when you write `button("Save")`, macOS shows an `NSButton` and Android
shows a Material button.
